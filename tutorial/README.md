##  Tutorial file descriptions
  - [tutorial/Larry-InvitroDiff.ipynb](https://github.com/czythu/scLTkit/blob/main/tutorial/Larry-InvitroDiff.ipynb): This Jupyter notebook contains the complete analysis pipeline and results for the hematopoietic differentiation data
  presented in Figure 1 of "Lineage tracing on transcriptional landscapes links state to fate during differentiation". The analysis follows two key steps `runLTStatistics` and `runLTAnalyses`.
  Except for the differential analysis including all cell subtypes, the analysis are also performed specifically on several cell subtypes of interest.
  - [tutorial/TraCeseq-tumor.ipynb](https://github.com/czythu/scLTkit/blob/main/tutorial/TraCeseq-tumor.ipynb): This Jupyter notebook contains the complete analysis pipeline and results for the Erlotinib-perturbed lung cancer cell line
  presented in Figure 1 of "Identifying transcriptional programs underlying cancer drug response with TraCe-seq". The analysis also follows two key steps `runLTStatistics` and `runLTAnalyses`.
