##  Tutorial file descriptions
  - [tutorial/Larry-InvitroDiff.ipynb](https://github.com/czythu/scLTkit/blob/main/tutorial/Larry-InvitroDiff.ipynb): This Jupyter notebook contains the complete analysis pipeline and results for the hematopoietic differentiation data
  presented in `Figure 1` of [Caleb Weinreb et al.](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaw3381) The analysis follows two key steps `runLTStatistics` and `runLTAnalyses`.
  Except for the differential analysis including all cell subtypes, the analysis are also performed specifically on several cell subtypes of interest.
